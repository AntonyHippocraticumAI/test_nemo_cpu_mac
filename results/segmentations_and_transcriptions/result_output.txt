speaker_0 [13.98-24.42]: great great so um how can i help you today yeah look um basically i'm just uh experiencing severe
speaker_0 [24.42-30.70]: pain in my kind of like lower back and also abdomen um it's been happening for the last
speaker_0 [30.70-35.88]: couple of days and uh it kind of comes and goes but when it's there it's really really bad and
speaker_0 [35.88-43.08]: painful um i'm also feeling nauseous and i guess most scarily of all i i not just some
speaker_1 [43.08-49.14]: blood in my urine um yeah i'm kind of worried about that yeah i can that's definitely concerning
speaker_1 [49.14-54.26]: so um let's let's uh let me ask you a few questions have you experienced any
speaker_1 [54.42-61.18]: urinary changes such as uh you know frequency or urgency or any kind of difficulty passing urine
speaker_1 [61.18-70.50]: um no not not really i mean i've noticed that my urine has the output has slightly decreased
speaker_0 [70.50-79.98]: but yeah no difficulty or pain nothing okay um have you ever uh had a similar episode in the
speaker_1 [79.98-84.40]: past oh no no uh this is the first time i would have remembered if i had
speaker_1 [84.42-92.50]: something like this before i see um have you has there been any recent trauma or injury to your
speaker_1 [92.50-101.40]: your back or abdomen or anything in your in your midsection no not really doctor i i haven't had
speaker_0 [101.40-108.12]: any no i haven't had any recent injuries um the pain kind of just appeared out of nowhere
UNK [108.12-114.20]: i see okay so i think we should run some tests
UNK [114.42-121.86]: but based on your symptoms i think you might have kidney stones i think we might be that that might
UNK [121.86-127.60]: be the thing we're dealing with you know especially this the back pain the the the
UNK [127.60-133.36]: especially the presence of blood in the urine is indicative of this typical of this condition
UNK [133.36-138.36]: but let let's confirm with some tests but i think that that's where i think that's what we're
UNK [138.36-144.10]: looking at okay uh kidney stones huh i've um yeah i mean
UNK [144.42-150.62]: i've heard of them um some of my family members had them never thought i would have them um but
UNK [150.62-158.18]: yeah um what what tests should we do so first we'll need to analyze your urine for signs of
UNK [158.18-164.18]: infection or stones that we can do today should be you know once we finish up the nurse will come
UNK [164.18-170.88]: in she'll do a quick urine you know urine pull should be uh relatively quick um the other thing
UNK [170.88-174.40]: that i i want to run is a uh a blood test so i'm going to run a blood test and i'm going to run a
UNK [174.42-178.96]: i just want to confirm that there's nothing going wrong with your kidney function uh just to make
UNK [178.96-183.60]: sure everything's kind of you know your blood is still being filtered and cleaned your kidneys are
UNK [183.60-189.14]: still performing basically um the the thing we'll do again that the blood test the nurse will
UNK [189.14-194.86]: come in later she can she can pull that uh before you leave today so after we run those tests it
UNK [194.86-201.68]: should be about a day maybe two days to before we get an answer uh but you know we'll get an answer
UNK [204.42-209.82]: in a couple of weeks okay so we'll see what happens so what we'll also do is i'm gonna i'm gonna
UNK [209.82-216.54]: schedule you uh a follow-up for a renal ultrasound what this will do is this this is typically uh
UNK [216.54-222.52]: you know they'll visualize your your kidneys and if there are any large stones we'll get a clear
UNK [222.52-230.06]: picture on how many how big they are that sort of thing uh so nothing you know just some initial
UNK [230.06-234.16]: tests nothing invasive okay okay yeah um i mean i'm i'm happy that we'll be able to figure out
UNK [234.16-241.04]: what's happening really want to get rid of this pain um what should i expect in terms of treatment
UNK [241.04-247.54]: if we confirm that these are kidney stones so kidney stones are very treatable very typical
UNK [247.54-253.18]: problem it happens in a large segment of the population so it's nothing to be afraid of
UNK [253.18-259.86]: in terms of treatment a lot of times it's as simple as you know increasing your hydration
UNK [259.86-264.02]: you know being very dedicated in uh increasing your hydration like
UNK [264.02-264.14]: you
UNK [264.14-268.94]: i want you know ideally you'll be drinking like at least almost half a gallon of water a day maybe
UNK [268.94-273.48]: more and we can we can kind of i'll do you know we'll have a bit of a look on exactly how much
UNK [273.48-280.34]: you should be taking but really over hydrating um uh some pain management so we'll you know
UNK [280.34-284.82]: if we confirm the diagnosis typically you know we'll give you a prescription for some pain
UNK [284.82-294.00]: management uh uh drugs and then uh ideally you just pass the
UNK [294.00-299.34]: stones naturally as part of that process um they'll oh sorry there's also some medications
UNK [299.34-305.18]: around just making it easier to pass the stones in your urine so some medications that'll help
UNK [305.18-310.36]: break down the stones in your kidneys and just you know hopefully they're small and they just
UNK [310.36-319.28]: pass through um so a lot of the times it's just medication in some cases i would say uh
UNK [319.28-323.52]: you know a good chunk of cases uh if the stones are a little too large
UNK [324.00-330.20]: they're causing some complications we one of the things we'll do is uh we'll probably do is a
UNK [330.20-337.10]: shockwave lithotripsy okay that's where you're suspended in a in a in a water effectively liquid
UNK [337.10-343.48]: bath and essentially ultrasonic waves are shot at your at the stones in your kidneys
UNK [343.48-349.32]: with the goal of essentially breaking them up and making them smaller so that you can pass them
UNK [349.32-353.86]: uh normally in very rare circumstances
UNK [353.86-361.30]: we may also have to schedule a surgery but i i don't i don't that's not a typical uh case but
UNK [361.30-366.22]: you know we'll have to see based on the results of the test but i wouldn't worry too much about
UNK [366.22-370.94]: it it's pretty standard there's not that you know that's uh it's a very well understood
UNK [370.94-376.00]: uh both a well understood disease and also well understood process so it's nothing life
UNK [376.00-381.82]: threatening nothing to worry about okay thank you thanks for clarifying that yeah let's definitely
UNK [381.82-383.82]: hope it's not going to be any surgical
UNK [383.86-391.00]: but uh yeah i really really appreciate the explanation um i think let's let's move forward
UNK [391.00-397.16]: with this then okay so i'll uh i'll uh call in the nurse she'll finish up the you know finish
UNK [397.16-401.88]: up a little bit of my write-up call the nurse she'll take your tests we should know we should
UNK [401.88-408.20]: have pretty good confirmation within 24 hours 24 to 48 hours once the lab results come back um and
UNK [408.20-412.22]: then we can schedule you for the follow-up stuff there and if you go to the front desk they'll
UNK [412.22-413.34]: schedule you for the ultrasound
UNK [413.86-420.16]: okay okay great thank you so much doctor and uh yeah have a good day thank you
UNK [420.16-422.66]: have a good day bye
